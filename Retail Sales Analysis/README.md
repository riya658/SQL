# Analysis
1. Product Analysis:   Conducted an analysis of the data to understand the different product lines, identify the product lines performing best, and determine the product lines that need                           improvement.
2. Sales Analysis:     This analysis aims to answer the question of sales trends for each product. The results can help us measure the effectiveness of each sales strategy the business 
                       applies and determine what modifications are needed to increase sales.
3. Customer Analysis:  This analysis aims to uncover the different customer segments, purchase trends, and the profitability of each customer segment.

# Approach

1. Data Wrangling:
- Inspected data to detect NULL values and missing values.
- Replace missing or NULL values.

2. Building a Database:
- Create tables to store the data.

3. Feature Engineering:
- Generate new columns from existing ones to provide additional insights.
  - `time_of_day`: Categorize sales into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
  - `day_name`: Extract the day of the week (Mon, Tue, etc.) from transaction dates.
  - `month_name`: Extract the month of the year (Jan, Feb, etc.) from transaction dates.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Performed analysis to address the following using SQL queries:
     - Which part of the day sees the most sales?
     - Which day of the week is each branch busiest?
     - Which month of the year has the highest sales and profit?
